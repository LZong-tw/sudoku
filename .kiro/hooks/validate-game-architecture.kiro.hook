Game architecture patterns - ensure proper separation of concerns (Game, Ghost, Pipe, PipeManager, CollisionDetector, Renderer, InputHandler, AudioManager, ScoreManager)\n2. Modular design - verify each module has a single responsibility and clear interfaces\n3. Collision detection algorithms - validate collision logic is accurate, efficient, and properly handles edge cases\n4. Code quality - check for proper encapsulation, minimal coupling, and adherence to existing patterns\n\nProvide specific feedback if any issues are found."
