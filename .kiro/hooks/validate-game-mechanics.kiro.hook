Physics constants (gravity, velocity, acceleration) are reasonable and won't cause game-breaking behavior\n3. Scoring logic maintains integrity (no negative scores, proper increment logic, score persistence)\n4. Boundary checks prevent out-of-bounds errors\n5. Constants are properly typed and within expected ranges\n\nRun relevant tests if available and report any issues found."
